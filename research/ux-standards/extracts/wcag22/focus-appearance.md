# Understanding Focus Appearance

## In brief

**Goal** —
Make it easier to spot the keyboard focus.

**What to do** —
Use a focus indicator of sufficient size and contrast.

**Why it's important** —
Many people can't see small changes in visual appearance, including older people.

## Intent of Focus Appearance

The purpose of this success criterion is to ensure a keyboard focus indicator is clearly visible and
discernible. Focus Appearance is closely related to [2.4.7 Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html) and [1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html).
Focus Visible requires that a visible focus indicator exists while a component has keyboard focus; Focus
Appearance defines a minimum level of visibility. Where Non-text Contrast requires a component to have
adequate contrast against the background in each of its states, Focus Appearance requires sufficient
contrast for the focus indicator itself.

For sighted people with mobility impairments who use a keyboard or a device that utilizes the keyboard interface
(such as a switch or voice input), knowing the current point of focus is very important. Visible focus must also meet the needs
of users with low vision, who may also rely on the keyboard.

A keyboard focus indicator can take different forms. This Success Criterion encourages the use of a solid
outline around the focused user interface component, but allows other types of indicators that are at least
as large.

This Understanding document will elaborate on the minimum area requirement, color contrast requirements, and
finally list some user agent exceptions.

### Minimum area

The first part of the success criterion specifies a minimum area for the focus indicator:

- is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused
component or sub-component

This only specifies a minimum area for the focus indicator. It does not require that the focus indicator
literally be a 2 CSS pixel thick outline, only that the indicator be at least that large.

However, the simplest way to meet the size requirement is to use a focus indicator which _is_ a
solid 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter.

A CSS pixel is what developers use in CSS declarations like “width: 200px”. It is
device-independent and not to be confused with device pixels which vary depending on the physical pixel
density.

The rest of this document notates CSS pixels as “px”.

#### Using a solid outline

The easiest and most common way to meet this requirement is to use a solid outline around the
component. The outline must be at least 2px thick. The following illustration shows a
**minimally** thick focus indicator, where a 2px thick band of white pixels making up
the page background around an example button have been altered to black.

Passes: The focus indicator is a solid 2px thick outline.

For non-rectangular components, the "perimeter" definition allows authors to use either of the
following types of outline:

- a line which solidly encloses a shape, or

- a line which solidly encloses the minimum bounding box of a shape

For example, a star-shaped button may use either a focus indicator that follows the shape of the star
or a focus indicator that follows the bounding box of the star. In the following examples, the same
three stars have already been selected, and focus is on the third star. The first example uses a
focus indicator which matches the star shape of the focused star. The second uses a rectangular
indicator.

Passes: a solid outline indicator surrounds the third of five stars.

Passes: a solidly bound focus rectangle encloses the third of five stars.

Offsetting indicators slightly from the focused component, as in the examples above, is not required
to meet the minimum area requirement of the success criterion, but it can help make indicators more
visible. In CSS, the `outline` and `outline-offset` properties are commonly
used to achieve this.

The smallest possible 2 CSS pixel thick indicator that is still a "perimeter" is a solid line that
appears inside the component against the component's outer edge, for example by using a CSS
`border` property. Indicators that are inset further within the component (not directly
against the component's outer edge) need to be thicker than 2 CSS pixels to meet the minimum size
requirement.

All four of these example focus indicators are 2px solid lines. The "outset", "outline",
and "border" indicators pass. The "inset" indicator does not meet the minimum area requirement
and fails; it would need to be at least 3px thick to pass.

Note that different Non-text Contrast requirements may apply depending on whether the focus indicator
is offset from, inset into, or against the edge of the component. See the [Relationship with Non-text Contrast](#relationship-with-non-text-contrast) section
below.

#### Other indicator shapes

This success criterion does not require that focus indicators be solid outlines. Other shapes may be
used so long as they meet the minimum area requirement.

The minimum area of the focus indicator for a control is the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of
the control (or its minimum bounding box) in the control's unfocused state. For example, if a
control is a rectangle 90px wide and 30px tall, the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter is
difference between the areas of:

- A 92px by 32px rectangle (1px larger on all sides), and

- A 88px by 28px rectangle (1px smaller on all sides)

This results in a minimum area of (92px * 32px) - (88px * 28px) = 480px2.

Some general formulas for 2 CSS pixel thick perimeters of common shapes are:

**Rectangle with width _w_ and height _h_** —
4_h_ + 4_w_

**Circle with radius _r_** —
4𝜋_r_

**Rounded rectangle with width _w_, height _h_, and border radius _r_** —
4_h_ + 4_w_ - (16 - 4𝜋)_r_

If you need to use complex mathematics to work out if a focus indicator is large enough,
it is probably a sign that you should use a larger indicator instead. The bigger the visible change
when an item receives focus, the easier it is for someone to see.

The following 2 examples use a 90px wide by 30px tall button, with a minimum area requirement of
480px2:

Passes: the inner outline is inset slightly from the outer edge of the component, but
compensates for this by being 3px thick. It has an area of 612px2, which exceeds the
480px2 minimum.

Passes: the indicator rectangles on either side of the focused button are each 9px wide
by 28px tall. In total, they are 504px2, which just barely meets the
480px2 minimum.

Prefer using focus indicator techniques that scale with both the width and height of the
focused control. Otherwise, if controls change size across different variations of a page (for
example, in a responsive design), the indicator might meet the area requirement in some variations
but not others. For example, in the above figure, if the width of the two highlight rectangles did
not scale as the button grew wider, it would stop meeting the minimum area requirement if the button
needed to grow any wider to accommodate a longer button label.

Another way of achieving the area requirement is to alter the appearance of the entire component, for
instance by changing its color – provided that the new color has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
against the original color. This can be effective in a set of closely placed buttons. The following
example demonstrates this with 5 rating stars; the center star is filled in with a darker color to
indicate focus. However, it is much more difficult to detect such a focus indicator when components
are not near each other and so cannot be easily compared. For users using magnification, even
components relatively close together may be difficult to compare, so it is not considered a best
practice.

Passes: a color change applies to the whole third star to indicate focus.

#### Inline links

If an inline link is broken over multiple lines, some methods of creating a focus indicator create
different results by browsers. CSS `outline` separately surrounds each part of a link
that breaks across multiple lines. It is by far the most common CSS technique for focus indication,
and produces a result that satisfies the minimum bounding box definition since each part is solidly
bound. CSS `border` will split the perimeter across the parts of the link, which results
in an unenclosed border for each line of the link. The minimum bounding box definition states that
link focus can be assessed as if the link was all on one line, so a 2px thick border is also
considered to meet the minimum area requirement. Therefore, where the contrast requirements are met,
each of these methods can produce a sufficient focus indicator.

Passes: the CSS `outline` property solidly bounds each part of the link
completely, so it meets the definition of a perimeter.

Passes: Although the CSS `border` on a multi-line link does not enclose the
separate parts of the link, the minimum bounding box definition allows it to be assessed as if
it was on a single line, so it also qualifies as a perimeter.

### Change of contrast

The second part of the Success Criterion's indicator requirements states that an area of the indicator:

- has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states

This requirement measures the change of contrast between the same pixels in different states. This is
different from the Text Contrast and Non-text Contrast Success Criteria, which measure the contrast
between different adjacent pixels in a single state at a time.

3:1 is the **minimum** allowable change-of-contrast ratio, but the greater the change of
contrast between states, the easier it is for users to see the focus indicator. Authors are encouraged
to make the change-of-contrast ratio as great as possible.

The following illustration shows a **minimally** contrasting focus indicator, where some of
the white pixels making up the page background have been altered to a mid-grey that has a 3:1 contrast
ratio with the original white. Authors are encouraged to exceed the minimum focus appearance. For
instance, the dark blue lines in figures 2 and 3 are much more visible.

Passes: Two buttons in the shape of a star, with the second surrounded by a focus indicator
whose pixels contrast 3:1 between focused (light grey) and unfocused (white) states.

When a component changes to include a focus indicator, that change can be measured as a change of color
contrast. For example, if a yellow outline is added to a button on a blue background, the change of
color is from blue to yellow. This change can be measured whether the focus indicator is on the
background around the component, or the background within the component.

Passes: adding a yellow outline to a link is a change of color from blue to yellow. That
change has a contrast ratio of 12:1.

If a control receiving focus changes its background (fill color) to a color that contrasts less than 3:1
with the original background, that would not pass the change of contrast.

Fails: the second link has a dark-grey (#555) which **fails** this Success
Criterion because the change from black-background to dark-grey background does not meet 3:1.

If the background change is sufficient, it is a method of passing the criterion.

Passes: the second link has a white background (#fff) which **passes** this
success criterion because the change from black-background to white-background meets 3:1.

#### Partially contrasting indicators

It is not necessary for the _entire_ focus indicator to have a 3:1 change of contrast. It is
sufficient for just a part of the indicator to meet the change of contrast requirement, so long as
the contrasting part of the indicator meets the minimum area requirement.

Passes: The black part of the indicator meets 3:1 contrast with the white background,
but the gray part does not. The black part is 2px thick, so it meets the minimum area
requirement on its own and the gray part can be ignored.

Fails: The indicator as a whole is 2px thick, but the part of it that has sufficient
change-of-contrast is only 1px thick. The part of the indicator with sufficient
change-of-contrast does not meet the minimum area requirement.

When calculating whether a focus indicator meets the minimum area requirement, only the part of the
indicator which meets the change-of-contrast requirement should be included in the calculation.

#### Gradients

If a focus indicator has a gradient, the principle is to measure the contrast of the changed area,
and ignore any part of the gradient which has less than a 3:1 change-of-contrast ratio.

When a gradient is used on a focus indicator, the measure of surface area should only
include the area that has changed enough to meet the 3:1 contrast ratio.

If you eliminate the area which has less than 3:1 change-of-contrast, you can calculate the area of
the remaining parts of the indicator to determine whether the indicator meets the minimum area
requirement.

Passes: the same focused button with the non-contrasting areas removed. The contrasting
area is 6px thick along most of the bottom edge and 3-4px thick on the left and right edges,
which is enough to meet the minimum area requirement.

Some of the examples in this document are screen-captured images of elements. Due to
loss of resolution in these images, the actual pixel color may not match the original. As such, they
are intended to be used for illustrative purposes, and should not be inspected on a pixel-by-pixel
basis for sufficient contrast.

Some designs have pages with a non-solid background image covering the whole (or part) of the page or
make use of parallax scrolling effects which result in a near-infinite number of color combinations
if a page is scrolled and/or changes are made to the viewport size.

If the contrast of background colors that change are close enough to need to be tested for each
combination then they would likely not meet the user need of people with low vision in certain
scroll combinations and would likely fail in certain combinations as well. In these cases it would
be an easy solution to use a [two-color
focus indicator](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Techniques/css/C40) or some other mechanism to indicate focus such as a solid box with a border
to guarantee there is sufficient contrast across variations of background images or background
gradients.

It is possible to use visual patterns such as strips switching places to disguise a change of focus
indicator. However, this is not considered a visible indicator.

### Relationship with Non-text Contrast

Focus indicators are visual information required to identify a state of a user interface component. That
means that they are subject to [1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](non-text-contrast), in
addition to 2.4.13 Focus Appearance.

In combination with [2.4.7 Focus Visible](focus-visible), [1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](non-text-contrast) requires that the visual focus indicator for a component
must have sufficient contrast against the adjacent colors when the component is focused, except where
the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by the author.

The difference between the contrast requirements in Focus Appearance and Non-text Contrast is:

- Focus Appearance requires that focus indicators have a _change of contrast_ between focused
and non-focused states.

- Non-text Contrast requires that focus indicators have _adjacent contrast_ between the
indicator (in the focused state) and adjacent non-indicator colors.

This example passes Focus Appearance but _fails Non-text Contrast_; there is insufficient
**adjacent contrast** between the focus indicator (light gray border) and the adjacent colors (white background and light blue button).

This example passes Non-text Contrast but _fails Focus Appearance_; there is insufficient
**change of contrast** between the focused (dark gray border) and unfocused states (black border).

Additionally, Non-text Contrast does not establish any size requirement and has slightly different rules
for when exceptions are allowed.

See the Relationship with Focus Visible section of [Understanding 1.4.11 Non-text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)
for more details and examples.

### Component keyboard focus

The preamble to this success criterion is "When a user interface component has keyboard focus..." The
_keyboard focus_ is the point of interaction for someone using a keyboard. For environments with
a keyboard-operable interface, the keyboard focus can be moved around the interface in order to interact
with different components. Whichever component is being interacted with has focus.

WCAG defines _user interface component_ as "a part of the content that is perceived by users as a
single control for a distinct function." Because different users may perceive controls differently,
there is a potential for some variation when interpreting what constitutes both a _single
control_ and a _distinct function_. This is particularly the case when something visually
presents in a way that may differ from how it is programmatically created under the covers. Where there
is not a native HTML component upon which to base designs, there can be great variations in how the
components and their focus indicators are portrayed. Further, some components have sub-components that
can take focus, such as the menu items on a menu.

Nonetheless, consistent results from different testers were obtained for this success criterion by using
the focus indicator itself as the gauge of what constitutes the component being interacted with. For
complex components, the three typical focus indicators are as follows:

- Focus indicator around only the whole component

- Focus indicators around both the component and subcomponent

- Focus indicator around only the subcomponent

Each of these will be discussed, using a tablist as a familiar complex component.

#### Focus indicator around only the whole component

A tablist with a focus indicator around only the whole.

When the focus indicator is shown only around the whole tablist, the user is guided to considering the
tablist as a single user component. The tab items within it are visually distinguished between selected
and unselected states (and visual indicators of selection state must meet the criteria given in [1.4.11 Non-text
Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html)).

Having a focus indicator _only_ around the whole is possible where there is no need to have a
selected sub-component while another sub-component has focus. For a tablist which synchronizes its tab
panel content with whatever tab is active, only one tab item can be selected at a time, and since
whatever tab is selected is considered active, a separate focus indicator is redundant.

Result: the group focus indicator must meet the requirements of this success criterion.

A [radio button group](https://codesandbox.io/s/practical-cori-nl4pld?file=/index.html) and a
[star-rating
widget](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/slider/slider-rating.html), which each use only a whole-component focus indicator, provide working examples of
different complex components that pass the primary requirements of this success criterion. In the star
ratings example, users can increment the rating by 1/2 stars. Not only is a focus indicator for each 1/2
star unnecessary, but it would actually be difficult to achieve without making the interaction
confusing.

#### Focus indicators around both the component and subcomponent

The same tablist in two states. In the first, focus is around both the tablist and the
currently selected tab; in the second, focus is around both the tablist and an unselected tab.

For a tablist which does not keep its tab panel content synchronized with whatever tab is selected, there
needs to be a focus indicator for the tab item subcomponent. This is because the tab item with focus may
be different than the selected item.

The user can navigate to the tablist, which in this implementation has a focus rectangle around the whole
tablist as well as one around a tab item (conventionally the item that is currently selected). The focus
around the whole is helpful in cueing a keyboard user that this is a complex component that has its own
interaction. The user can then move focus between the unselected and selected tab items -- each of which
in turn has its own focus indicator -- before activating one, which then makes it selected as well as
focused, and updates the tab panel to match.

In this scenario, either the group focus indicator or the sub-component indicator must meet the
requirements of this success criterion. To avoid being overly prescriptive, the success criterion allows
authors to choose which makes the most sense. Generally, if a sub-component focus is necessary, it
should be assessed instead of the group indicator.

Result: the focus indicator for the tab item meets the requirements of this success criterion. The
tablist focus indicator does not need to meet the requirements.

A [slider to pick
colors](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/example-index/slider/slider-color-viewer.html) provides a working example of a different complex component that predominantly shows
focus for the subcomponent. In this case, the thumb slider sub-component has a focus indicator of
sufficient size and contrast to pass the sufficient area calculation. There is also a subtle focus
around the whole slider component, but it does not need to be assessed to pass this success criterion.

#### Focus indicator around only the subcomponent

The same tabs as in the prior set, but the focus indicator around the whole is removed.

The same unsynchronized tablist can also be implemented as something which only shows focus on the tab
items and not on the whole. The behavior is the same as in the prior example, but there is never a
focus indicator placed around the tablist. This interaction is acceptable, but it is not best practice
since it demands more understanding from the user with less information. For example, some visual cues
for the tablist and tab items (and tab panel) may not be clear. As well, keyboard users may not
initially understand the expected keyboard interaction.

Result: the focus indicator for the tab item must meet the requirements of this Success Criterion,
judging focus with both selected and unselected tab items.

A [functional example of sub-component-only tab focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role#example) has an indicator that is large enough (at
least four times the shortest side) with sufficient contrast to pass the focus area language of this
success criterion.

#### Where something with focus is not a user interface component

Some pages contain very large editing regions, such as web implementations of word processors and code
editors. Unlike a `textarea` element, which is a user interface component, these large
editing regions do not typically meet the definition of user interface components;
they are not "perceived by users as a single control for a distinct function."
Providing focus indicators around such editing regions may still be beneficial to some; however, where
the region is not perceived as a single control, it is not covered by this success criterion. The web
page will still need to provide an insertion point (caret indicator) in such editing regions in order to
meet the requirements of [2.4.7
Focus Visible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/focus-visible.html).

Some non-operable elements can take focus (such as a heading element that is the target of a skip link).
However, the preamble of this success criterion refers to user interface components; it is only when the
element with focus is operable by keyboard that this success criterion applies.

### Exceptions

There are two situations where the focus appearance does not need to be assessed:

- the focus indicator cannot be adjusted by the author

- the author has not modified the effects of the user agent default

#### First exception: the focus indicator cannot be adjusted by the author

The focus indicator is determined by the user agent and cannot be adjusted by the author

Some components or technologies may not allow the author to adjust the focus indicator. This is the
case with HTML `select` elements (both single and multi-select), where the visual
treatments for selection and focus cannot be adjusted by the author. In this case the Success
Criterion does not apply.

Passes: The user agent's default `select` element presentation cannot be
modified by the author, so it passes regardless of the quality of the focus indicator

#### Second exception: the default indicator and background are not modified

The focus indicator and the indicator's background color are not modified by the author

If the focus indicator and the background behind the focus indicator are not modified by the author,
the success criterion does not apply.

The intent of this exception is to reduce burden on authors by allowing them to rely on the default
indicators provided by user agents (browsers). If all user agents provided good focus indicators,
authors would be able to concentrate efforts on other accessibility considerations. Unfortunately,
browser default focus indicators vary by component, browser, and across devices and operating
systems, and the default focus indicators in some browsers can be difficult to see (such as a 1px
dotted outline). For this reason, most authors override browser defaults in order to overcome these
deficiencies and create a more uniform user experience, regardless of browser.

Some browser makers are improving their default focus indicators to make them more visible. As more
browsers adopt defaults that meet the primary bullets of this Success Criterion, authors will be
able to achieve improved focus indicators without customization.

#### Modifying the focus indicator background

Browser default focus indicators can be made _more_ difficult to see if the author modifies
the pixels directly adjacent to the indicator (commonly referred to as its background), such as by
positioning a component on top of an image or gradient background, or altering the page's default
white background color, for instance using a blue background in combination with a browser's blue
default indicator. For this reason, where the author alters the pixels directly adjacent to the
default focus indicator, the user agent exception does not apply, and the author will need to verify
they meet the size and contrast requirements of this success criterion.

Altering the `body` element's `background-color` attribute
_is_ one way of altering the pixels directly adjacent to the indicator in most
implementations. However, specifying a value of white (`#FFFFFF`) does not nullify this
exception since, as established in the third note of the contrast ratio definition, the
default ("unspecified") color is assumed to be white.

As well, if the browser provides an indicator _within_ a component by default, then authors
can potentially reduce the visibility by changing the component color (which in such a scenario is
the background color for the focus indicator). For example, if the default indicator on a button
uses a colored inner border, authors can negatively affect the focus appearance by making the button
or its unfocused border color a similar-luminosity color. For this reason, this user agent exception
can only be met if the author both does not modify the default focus indicator _and_ does not
modify its background.

Fails: The middle button is focused using a browser's default focus indicator, but it is
very difficult to tell which button is focused because the custom blue border on the unfocused
button uses a similar color.

## Benefits of Focus Appearance

- This success criterion helps anyone who relies on the keyboard to operate the page, by letting them
visually determine the component on which keyboard operations will interact at any point in time.

- People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in executive processes
benefit by being able to discover where the focus is located.

## Examples of Focus Appearance

- When links receive focus, an outline is displayed around the link that contrasts with the background
adjacent to the link.

- When buttons receive focus, an outline is displayed within the button (around the text) that contrasts
with the button's background.

- When text fields receive focus, an outline is displayed around the field, indicating that the input has
focus.

- When radio buttons receive focus, an outline is displayed around the control, indicating that the input
has focus.
