# Understanding No Keyboard Trap

## In brief

**Goal** —
Keyboard users don't get stuck.

**What to do** —
Ensure users always know how to navigate away from components.

**Why it's important** —
People who rely on the keyboard often have no other means to navigate.

## Intent of No Keyboard Trap

The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that content does not "trap"
keyboard focus within subsections of content on a web page. This is a common problem
when multiple formats are combined within a page and rendered using plug-ins or embedded
applications, or when custom components and widgets are not implemented with keyboard users
in mind.

There may be times when it's appropriate for a web page to restrict focus to a subsection
of the content – for example, when the user is inside a modal dialog or popover. This does
not fail the requirements of this criterion, as long as the user knows how to "untrap" the focus
and leave that component.

Keyboard focus is not considered trapped when the user can navigate away from a component
using only a keyboard interface, and if it only requires unmodified arrow or `Tab` keys
or other "standard exit methods". This specification does not define what constitutes a
"standard exit method" – this is dependent on the user's hardware, user agent, and operating system,
and as such will require some interpretation from authors and auditors. Generally, in most
environments with a physical keyboard, pressing the `Esc` key is a commonly
used "standard exit method", but other platform-specific methods may be available.

If untrapping focus requires a different method (rather than unmodified arrow keys, the `Tab` key, or
other "standard exit methods"), content can still pass this criterion provided that the user is
advised how they can untrap focus using their keyboard interface.

## Benefits of No Keyboard Trap

- People who rely on a keyboard or keyboard interface to use the web including people
who are blind and people with physical disabilities.

## Examples of No Keyboard Trap

**A calendar widget** —
A calendar widget allows users to add, remove or update items in their calendar using
the keyboard. The controls in the widget are part of the tab order within the web
page, allowing users to tab through the controls in the widget as well as to any links
or controls that follow.

**A puzzle applet** —
Once a user tabs into an applet, further tabs and other keystrokes are handled by
the applet. Instructions describing the keystroke used to exit the applet are provided
prior to the applet as well as within the applet itself.

**A modal dialog box** —
A web application opens a dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog are two buttons,
"Cancel" and "OK". When the dialog is open, focus is trapped within the dialog –
tabbing from the last control in the dialog takes focus to the first control in the
dialog (though, depending on implementation, the focus cycle might still include
user agent controls). The dialog is dismissed by activating the "Cancel" button,
the "OK" button, or the `Esc` key.

**A WYSIWYG rich text editor** —
Once the main editing area of a rich text editor receives focus, `Tab` /
`Shift+Tab` are used to set the indentation of the current line being edited.
When the editing area receives focus, an instruction appears, letting users know that
they can use `Alt+F10` / `Option+F10` to move focus back out of the
area and to the editor toolbar.
