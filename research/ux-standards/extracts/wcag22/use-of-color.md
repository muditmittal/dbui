# Understanding Use of Color

## In brief

**Goal** — Color is not the only way of distinguishing information.

**What to do** — Use information in addition to color, such as shape or text, to convey meaning.

**Why it's important** — Not everyone sees colors or sees them the same way.

## Intent of Use of Color

The intent of this success criterion is to ensure that all sighted users can access information
that is conveyed by color differences, that is, by the use of color where each color
has a meaning assigned to it. If the information is conveyed through color differences
in an image (or other non-text format), the color may not be seen by users with color
deficiencies. In this case, providing the information conveyed with color through
another visual means ensures users who cannot see color can still perceive the information.

Color is an important asset in the design of web content, enhancing its aesthetic appeal,
its usability, and its accessibility. However, some users have difficulty perceiving
color. People with partial sight often experience limited color vision, and many older
users do not see color well. In addition, people using limited-color or
monochrome displays and browsers will be unable to access information that is presented
only in color.

Examples of information conveyed by color differences: “required fields are red",
“error is shown in red", and “Mary's sales are in red, Tom's are in blue". Examples
of indications of an action include: using color to indicate that a link will open
in a new window or that a database entry has been updated successfully. An example
of prompting a response would be: using highlighting on form fields to indicate that
a required field had been left blank.

This should not in any way discourage the use of color on a page, or even color coding if it is complemented by other visual indication.

If content is conveyed through the use of colors that differ not only in their hue,
but that also have a significant difference in lightness, then this counts as an additional
visual distinction, as long as the difference in relative luminance between the colors leads
to a contrast ratio of 3:1 or greater.
For example, a light green and a dark red differ **both** by color (hue)
**and** by lightness, so they would pass if the contrast ratio is at least 3:1.
Similarly, if content is distinguished by inverting an element's foreground and background colors,
this would pass (again, assuming that the foreground and background colors have a sufficient contrast).

However, if content relies on the user's ability to accurately perceive or differentiate a particular color
an additional visual indicator will be required regardless of the contrast ratio between those colors. For example,
knowing whether an outline is green for valid or red for invalid.

This criterion does not apply to situations where color has _not_ been used to convey information, indicate an action,
prompt a response or distinguish a visual element. For instance, a hyperlink which has been styled to appear no different than neighboring
static text would not fail this success criterion, as there would be no color differentiation between the actionable hyperlink text
and the adjacent static text. Such lack of styling differentiation could result in poor usability for anyone looking at the interface, regardless of disability.

This criterion does not directly address the needs of users with assistive technologies.
It aims to ensure that sighted users who cannot distinguish between some colors can still
understand content.
How information is conveyed to assistive technology users is covered separately in other
criteria, including (but not limited to)
[1.1.1 Non-text Content](non-text-content),
[1.3.1 Info and Relationships](info-and-relationships), and
[4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](name-role-value).

Conversely, even if information that is conveyed by color differences is appropriately conveyed
to assistive technologies, it does not necessarily pass this criterion, as sighted users who cannot
distinguish between certain color may not necessarily be using any assistive technologies. This
criterion requires a visible alternative to color.

Most user agents provide users with a color-only cue that a link has been previously activated by them ("visited"). However, several technical constraints result in authors having very limited control over these color-only indications of visited links.  The technical constraints are as follows:

- User agents constrain the exposure of a link's visited state due to [privacy concerns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Privacy_and_the_:visited_selector). Author queries to user agents will indicate all links have not been visited.

- Any available information on the visited state of a link would be inaccurate since it is both user and browser-dependent. Even if an author could accurately get information on previously activated links by a certain user, the author would be constrained to the current browser's preserved history, and would be unable to determine if the user had visited the page using a different browser (or if the history was not preserved, either from cache clearing or use of private sessions).

- Authors can _only_ use color to modify the `:visited` CSS pseudoclass style. The technology constrains any non-color styling. Due to palette limitations, an author cannot use color alone to achieve 3:1 contrast between link and non-link text as well as between visited and unvisited links while also achieving 4.5:1 contrast for all link and non-link text.

- Authors also cannot set the visited state of links. The anchor element does not include a "visited" attribute; therefore the author has no ability to alter the state through an attribute setting. As such, authors cannot achieve [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](info-and-relationships) or
[4.1.2 Name, Role, Value](name-role-value) in regard to visited links.

For these reasons, setting or conveying a link's visited status is not an author responsibility. Where color alone distinguishes between visited and unvisited links, it does not result in a failure of this Success Criterion, even where the contrast between the two link colors is below 3:1. Note that authors must continue to ensure that all text links meet contrast minimums against the page background (SC 1.4.3).

## Benefits of Use of Color

- Users with partial sight often experience limited color vision.

- Some older users may not be able to see color well.

- Users with color vision deficiency who cannot distinguish between certain colors
benefit when information conveyed by color is available in other visual ways.

- People using limited color monochrome displays may be unable to access
color-dependent information.

- Users who have problems distinguishing between colors can look or listen for text
cues.

## Examples of Use of Color

**A form that uses color and text to indicate required fields** —
A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the top of the
form explain that required fields are labeled with red text and also with an icon.
Users who cannot perceive the difference between the optional field labels and the
red labels for the required fields will still be able to see the icon next to the
red labels.

**An examination** —
Students view an SVG image of a chemical compound and identify the chemical elements
present based **both** on the colors used, as well as numbers next to each
element. A legend shows the color and number for each type of element. Sighted users who
cannot perceive all the color differences can still understand the image by relying on
the numbers.
